# Clojure FMI Lectures

The lectures for the [Clojure course in FMI Sofia](http://fmi.clojure.bg/).

This repository contains both the code needed to generate the lectures as HTML and the lectures themselves (as text files, in Bulgarian).

## Usage

If you want to compile all the lectures to HTML, just execute:

    $ lein run

If you want to compile a specific lecture (for example 7), you can run:

    $ lein run 7
